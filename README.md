# Declutter-Assistance
The Digital Declutter Assistant is a tool  developed to help users organize and clean up their digital files and folders. It analyzes a directory or cloud storage, identifies duplicate, large, and unused files, and provides suggestions for deletion, archiving, or moving. 


The goal was to create a user-friendly tool that simplifies the often overwhelming task of managing digital clutter, making it easier for individuals and businesses to maintain an organized digital workspace.
